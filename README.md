# Mocap - Multi-Camera AI Motion Capture System

![Mocap Demo](./Mocap_Demo.png)

A real-time AI-powered motion capture system built using Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and multi-camera 3D triangulation. The system captures human motion from multiple cameras, reconstructs a 3D skeleton in real time, and provides a foundation for animation retargeting, game development, virtual production, and character rigging workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-camera real-time motion capture
- 3D human pose reconstruction
- MediaPipe-based body tracking
- Robust RANSAC triangulation
- Camera calibration using ChArUco boards
- Real-time OpenGL 3D visualization
- Temporal smoothing and jump rejection
- Multi-camera scalability (2–10+ cameras)
- Distortion-aware triangulation
- Bundle Adjustment for accurate camera alignment
- Ready for animation retargeting pipelines

## Installation

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxeeranger/Mocap.git

cd Mocap
```

### Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate Environment

Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Camera Calibration

Generate calibration data using a ChArUco board.

```bash
python main.py
```

This produces:

```text
output/multi_cam_calibration.npz
```

which contains:

- Camera Intrinsics
- Camera Extrinsics
- Distortion Coefficients
- Bundle Adjusted Camera Poses

---

## Running Motion Capture

Start the real-time mocap system:

```bash
python run_pose_3d.py
```

The application will:

1. Load camera calibration
2. Start all connected cameras
3. Run MediaPipe pose estimation
4. Triangulate 3D joints
5. Apply smoothing
6. Render the live 3D skeleton

## Multi-Camera Support

Current architecture supports:

- 2 Cameras
- 3 Cameras
- 5 Cameras
- 8 Cameras
- 10+ Cameras

Configure in:

```python
NUM_CAMERAS = 5
```

inside:

```python
config.py
```

## Advanced Features

### Robust RANSAC Triangulation

Rejects:

- Occluded joints
- Incorrect detections
- Left/right swaps

before final 3D reconstruction.

### Temporal Smoothing

Reduces:

- Jitter
- Frame-to-frame noise
- Sudden skeleton jumps

### Bundle Adjustment

Global optimization refines all camera poses simultaneously, improving overall reconstruction accuracy.
